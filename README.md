DOTA 2 Game Prediction [Hacker Rank]

This is a DOTA 2 Game Prediction algorithm I wrote to submit for the HackerRank challenge available at https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dota2prediction

Algorithm description
======================

The program goes through the sample data provided, and gives a +1 point to each champion of the team that wins. Thus 
creating a database of champions with most their individual 'win score'.

Next up, it analyzes the input data received from the server. As it goes through the champions, giving each team a 
score based on the 'win score' of the champions in it. 

And the team with most points win in that matchup.
